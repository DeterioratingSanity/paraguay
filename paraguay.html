          So - You want to go to Paraguay? <br>
          It's... not about to be a fast trip. Assuming you mean to arrive directly in Asuncion, you had better pack a neck pillow and an ambien (barring you start already in South America, or in Madrid) - because not many aircraft <i>go</i> there.<br>
          Luckily, you can just stop over in Panama City, and make from New York to Asuncion in somewhere between 12 and 18 hours. If you make the flight with Panama's flag airline, Compania Panamena de Aviacion, or Copa,
          then the trip will cost about $350 - If you have to stop in Bogota, too, the flight could take you 35 or more hours!
          <img src="set1,1.jpg" class="displayImg">
          Here's where you'll be going - the <b>Silvio Pettirossi International Airport</b>. It sits in Luque, which is technically its own place, but logistically is a city inside of Asucion's metropolitan area. Luque isn't unique though - 20 cities
          hang out in that little bubble, along with ~30% of Paraguayans.

          It used to be named after Alfredo Stroessner, a guy who thought being a dictator was a very fun passtime, and is now named for an Italian immigrant who started an aviation club and
          passed when the wings fell off his plane while he performed a stunt... oops.<br>

          For the first fellow, it turns out that leading a military coup and becoming supreme leader for over 30 years, but not treating your army well, tends to result in another military coup leaving you in a less than pleasant position. He survived, though.
          Indeed, Mr Stroessner hid in Brazil for 17 years, until his guts got moldy because of pneumonia. Unfortunately, Mr Pettirossi wasn't so lucky.<br><br>

          He had a relatively interesting life, learning how to fly in France thanks to Paraguayan government scholarships prior to World War One. He got several flying records, bought a plane, and came home. Then, much as is stated above, he tricked too hard,
          the wings fell off his plane, and he fell into a cattle ranch, an accident he did not survive.<br><br>

          He got an airport named after him though... so I guess he did OK in the end.

          or you could stay at the Marriot franchise in the city center - your choice.<br><br>

          Unfortunately, there's not much to say on accomodations. Very few hotels are listed on travel sites, and fewer still have any reviews at all. Most of the hotels with reviews are

          Now, you don't want to end up in a reeducation camp for accidentally professing your undying loyalty to the dictator for life from <i>last</i> week, so you had better make sure you know who is in
          charge in your new vacation spot.<br><img src="set1,7.jpg" class="profileImg"><br><b>Mario Abdo Benitez</b><br><br>
          This man is the president of Paraguay. Like many presidents, he ditched his native education system and went to college in Connecticut. Then, he tried the army, after which he became a politician.
          He became a party leader, joined the senate, stayed in the senate, became the President of the Senate, and then decided the last three words of that title were boring.<br><br>
          Fun Fact: His dad was Stroesser's - yes Military Dictator For Life Stroesser's - private secretary, and has had to back-track his gratitude for Stroesser, confirming he was not in favor of crimes against
          humanity.<br><br>
          81% of Paraguayans feel that Mr Benitez is inept, largely because he and his government REALLY LIKE giving large ammounts of money to large landowners, taxing the economy into recession, and kicking
          his own interests in the shins in dealings with Brazil.

          This man is the <b>vice</b>-president of Paraguay. Because of the Brazil incident Mr Benitez was involved with - which was about a damn which would play funny business with Paraguayan water access, and
          his <i>alleged</i> bribing of investigators to a monumental degree, the United States government called him out for corruption - and when that happens, you have to be <b>really</b> corrupt.<br><br>
          This is what Mr Moreno did about it:<br>
          June 2022 - He says he means to run for President in 2023<br>
          August 2022 - Everything goes screwy - He says he won't run for president, and that he'll even resign the role he currently holds<br>
          August 2022 - He changes his mind, as nobody in Paraguay is investigating him<br>
          Back to previous status, as though nothing had occured - Good on you, Mr Moreno!

          But why, you might be asking, do I need to know these gentlement? Why couldn't I just remember whoever is in charge of Spain in the moment?<br><br>
          Well, my friends, thats because Paraguay became independent on November 25th, 1842- no wait, June 17th, 1843- no wait, September 14th, 1844, or was it July 17th, 1852. These are all dates

          This first fellow - Fulgencio Yegros - got independence under way, when he made the royal governor run awy from battles he could have easily won, crippling his power over the region. Then this second fellow, Jose Rodriguez de Francia,
          got elected a year later and called himself dictator for life in 1814... an auspicious start for any nation,<br> I suppose.

          That would be the Guarani, of course! They've been around for a while, and when the Europeans got here, it was a bit like this - On one side of the river were main-line Guarani, who

          On the other side of that river were the Guaycuru, who were nomads and thought walking or riding around

          It was founded by Olga Blinder and Carlos Colombino, and was originally a travelling exhibition of modern art - apparently the genuine antiquities came WITH the established, brick and

          religious discrepancies (see "Heresy") got the Jesuits who built the place kicked out, and got all their Saints decapitated - yes, really. It was supposed to be a city where the Guarani

          All that being said, lets see about Paraguay's history!<br><br>

          Paraguay was originally populated by the Guarani - and because Paraguay is in the backwoods of South America, they managed to escape cultural genocide. And regular genocide. Basically they avoided genocide.
          Not to say they didn't have a bad time. The Guarani were basically run over with a truck before being set on fire, but the truck of colonial / imperial Spain got a flat tire before they could reverse back over
          everybody... forceable Christianization tends to do that.<br><br>
          Beyond just the Christianization, you also have to contend with the issue of people only accepting new religion because the alternative was being enslaved. And sometimes, that was worth about as much as the paper
          clip on my boot is to an aggravated llama - that is, nothing. Slavers had a penchant for doing a little three step plan:<br>
          Wait for a Sunday, so everybody is close together<br>
          Burn down the monestary, and un-alive anybody who disagrees with you for doing that<br>
          Sell the rest.<br><br>
          Guarani society survived, though, because priests gave them guns on orders of the Pope - no, literally, so they could watch out for themselves.<br>

          Why is it called Paraguay? Why is it there? Why is the sky blue, rather than neon pink? These are all questions you might ask, but I can't answer them equally. Here is my best
          effort.<br><br>
          1. The Guarani words of "Feather Crown" (paragua) and "water" (y) - Combined to render "Feathered Crown of the Waters" - as there are rivers about.<br>

          Because its named for the native words, its pretty much always been called Paraguay, whether it was a principality, a governorate, a state, or whatever else in the rigamarole
          of the Spanish colonial bureaucracy. It has sometimes been lumped in with the "Governorate of the Rio de la Plata" - basically, everywhere near this river that gives
          me silver, which I like, for the Spanish.<br>

          Paraguay is about 406k square kilomiters, 2.6% of which is water - as one might guess, being that Paraguay is very wholly land-locked. Good job for having that much water
          at all, dry dry country.<br><br>
          It is very hot sometimes, but it doesn't have seasons, just wet and dry. Through its Spring and Summer, winds blow northward, whereas its Fall and Winter bring cooler Andean
          winds back South.

            This is Asuncion<br>
            It is the largest city in Paraguay, with 3 million out of Paraguays entire population (just 7 million, total) living in the city itself, or in its metropolitan area!<br><br>
            <img src="set3,4.jpg" class="displayImg"><br><br>
            
            Asuncion sits in the crook between rivers, on the border between Paraguay and Argentina. Rather than existing in another governmental state, it is an independently controlled
            city, much as Washington, D.C. is in the United States.

            The Paraguay River for which Paraguay as a nation is named is only half the length of the longest river in Paraguay, the Parana River.<br>
            The Parana travels 4900 kilometers south, crossing Paraguay and dipping into Argentina - I think for travel food, but maybe just because of the currents in that area.
            Along its length, the Parana plays jigsaw, merging with the eponymous rivers of Uruguay and Paraguay, until it becomes what the Spanish called the Rio de la Plata, for all
            the silver that came down it for them.<br>

            Mountains are bumps of rock and dirt that exist. That is a given. Unfortunately for Paraguayan mountaineers, they do not exist in any great number or promenance in Paraguay itself.
            If the aspiring mountaineer wants to practice their craft without acquiring a passport, then they will go to Cerro Tres Kandu, a hill which holds electric lines, phone cables, and a
            military radar repeater - the latter for which it is named. As technology consistently gets better while scrap costs consistently increase, these buildings are now empty and rusty - so
            you can go site-seeing on your hike. It is 842 meters tall (compared to 8,850 for Everest).<br>

            Paraguay is like a candy store if you're a nation that thinks iron, uranium, or limestone are candy. Or if you just want a ton of trees for a comparatively low cost (minus the cost of
            bribes, I suppose. The best natural resource in Paraguay, though, is the water. There is, practically speaking, a significant ammount of water. This, combined with a higher than average waterfalls
            per capital, means that Paraguay might just be able to support a massive hydroelectric system someday.<br>

            The culture of Paraguay is the culture of the Guarani (mixed with some immigrant stuff - both the original Spanish moving in and taking over the place, and later Italian and generic European
            and African immigration after Paraguay was a thing that existed on the radars of the wider world, rather than just the weird woods with strange fellows who are not Europeans*). Guarani villages
            shared households, and formed their own dialecets with which they identified as a group. They have star gods who rule broad concepts like night and existence, animistic dieties anthropomorphizing emotions
            , sentiments, and such. Then there are the Pombero goblins and their leader Jasy who likes drowning children and eating honey... Winnie the Pooh?

            Guarani, before encountering Europeans, wore very little, largely because it was catastrophically hot, and only British regulars wear wool uniforms in tropical weather. If your culture evolves in
            the tropics, it overcomes the mandate upon trousers with a remarkable speed. Women wore, and still sometimes wear, black body paints, whereas men wear red and black paints. Some wore earrings and lip
            rings fashioned from gold or shell, and religious charms produced from the hair of close family were sometimes worn tied around the limbs.<br>
            Guarani also adopted Peninsular styles, adopting the more common guise of Latin American inhabitants - though their culture remains vibrant.<br>

          One importat holiday and celibration in Paraguay falls on the 29th of September every year. It celebrates the Paraguayan victory in the first battle of the Chaco War,
          a conflict between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco region, which is today divided between Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, though 2/3 of the disputed area went
          to Paraguay. The celebration, Boqueron Battle Victory Day, remembers the end of the first battle of the war.

          The foremost annual festival in Paraguay is held in the honor of the patron saint of Paraguay, a fellow named St. Blaise (Blas). According to Catholics and the internet,
          he is in charge of wild animals - I guess rebellion likened thereto, and its why native populations who converted liked him. Basically everybody celebrates (as ~88% population is
          Catholic) - and there are massive parties rife with dancing, parades, and church services - the latter of course having a bit less party overall.<br>

          Another widely celebrated holiday is the anniversary of the founding of Asuncion - because whatever you think of colonialism, a day off work is a day off work!
          On the 15th of August, it remembers the firt Spanish fellows to doodle their way up the Paraguay River to each what is now Asuncion. <br><br>The guy in charge of that
          group as named Juan de Salazar etc., whose parents gave him somewhere in the neighborhood of far too many names. It was named for the feast day in the Catholic
          calendar which also fell on the 15th. As it was founded in 1541, it is a very very old city (duh) but is also one of the oldest surviving Spanish American cities
          (less duh, because reconquest, and also arson).<br><br>
          <img src="set4,6.jpg" class="displayImg"><br><br>
          It falls on the aforementioned feast day, so there will be a lot of churching everywhere, but there are also more lively celebrations in Asuncion proper, because
          people generally like to live in a place that exists rather than, well - not...

          Alongside being its ethnic group, the Guarani is also the name of Paraguayan money. It is represented by a G, unless you have special characters, which I suppose Paraguayan banks do.<br>
          <img src="set5,1.jpg" class="displayImg"><br>
          Inflation got significant enough that the Guarani no longer has fractions of itself registered as change, and now it has bills with more zeros than I do eyelashes.<br>
          Currently, one Guarani can get you about 0.00014 USD - immense, I know.<br><br>
          They tried to reboot their money with fewer zeros - I guess to make it look better - but did not, as they wanted to name it the same thing and that was, of course, confusing as anything.

          It turns out that failing to respond promptly to a pandemic when you are the leader of a nation being impacted by said pandemic is less than ideal. This has been attributed to the
            fact that payments made for things like medicine and hospital upkeep have instead gone into the back pockets of innumerable levels of government, from whence those dollars have not
            readily escaped.

          I mentioned it when I mentioned him, but now I'll mention it a bit more and him a bit less, but its a lot of the same rigamarole. The Vice President of Paraguay, a fellow we met earlier
          by the name of Hugo Moreno, thought it would be a great idea for him to do a lot of corruption and bribery, and then do a very bad job covering it up - so bad, in fact, that the US government
          had to tell him publically he was very corrupt and should be ashamed of himself. Whats worse, they cancelled his visa so Mr Moreno couldn't flee legal repurcussions at home...<br><br>
          Whats this, the man renowned for bribing court officials is NOT being investigated for that bribery by those court officials? Inconcievable!<br>

          Would you like to indulge in unfettered capitalism in a country whose economy is in shambles? I know you do! Come to Paraguay, go to a mall and shop for everything you want, for a bit less in price,
          and probably in reputability, too. <br>
          Shopping del Este in Ciudad del Este is a great idea if you want to go 5 hours by car to see a shopping mall - but of course you do! It has local stuff, and it has
          food (and drink, but only if you stay the night / bring friends), and an honest to goodness casino...<br><br>
          Alternatively, the economizing tourist can visit Nissei in Ciudad del Este, another shopping center / mall, but which claims more reputable brands and fewer casinos and liquid distribution
          shops. That alone makes it a better arrangement for tourists with a squadron of minute humanoids trailing them - if not for the quantity of technology which said gremlins will undoubtedly clamor
          for once they enter this shop of shinies.
          <br><br>
          Last but probably not least - again, I'm here, not there, is the Fuente Shopping de Salemma in San Lorenzo! It is yet another mall, but this one has multiple floors of capitalism in it,
          and there are escalators for you to distract your weird uncle with while you go and purchase seven kilos of cheese and a neon grey shirt.<br>
